    "# What is an \"Algebra\"\n",
    "- Mathematical sysem consisting of:\n",
    "    - Operands --- Variables or values from which new values can be constructed\n",
    "    - Operators --- sybmols denoting procedures that construct new values from given values\n",
    "- What is Relational Algebra\n",
    "    - An Algebra whose operands are relations or variables that represent relations\n",
    "    - Operators are designed to do the most common thins that we need to do with relations in a database\n",
    "        - The results is an algebra that can be used as a _query language_ for relations.\n",
    "- Core Relational Algebra\n",
    "    - Selection: picking certain rows\n",
    "    - projection: picking certain columns\n",
    "    - Products and joins: copositions of relations\n",
    "    - Renaming of relations and attributes\n",
    "- Selection\n",
    "    - $R_1 := \\sigma_c(R2)$\n",
    "    - $C$ is a condition (as in \"if\" statments) that refers to attributes of $R_2$\n",
    "    - $R_1$ is all those tuples of $R_2$ that satisfy $C$\n",
    "- Projection\n",
    "    - $R_1 := \\pi_L(R_2)$\n",
    "        - $L$ is a list of attributes from the schema of $R_2$\n",
    "        - $R_1$ is constructed by looking at each tuple of $R_2$, extracting the attributes on $L$, in the order specified, and creating from those components a tuple for $R_1$\n",
    "        - Eliminate duplicate types, if any\n",
    "- Extended Projection\n",
    "    - Using the same $\\pi_L$ operator, we allow the list $L$ to contain arbitrary expressions involving attributes:\n",
    "        1. Arithmetic on attributes, e.g., A+B -> C\n",
    "        2. Duplicate occurrences of the same attribute\n",
    "- Product\n",
    "    - $R_3 := R_1 \\times R_2$\n",
    "        - Pair each tuple $t_1$ of $R_1$ with each tuple $t_2$ of $R_2$\n",
    "        - Concatenation $t_1t_2$ is a tuple of $R_3$\n",
    "        - Schema of $R_3$ is the attributes of $R_1$ and then $R_2$ in order\n",
    "        - But bewere attribute $A$ of he same name in $R_1$ and $R_2$: use $R_{1.A}$ and $R_{2.A}$\n",
    "- Theta Join\n",
    "    - $R_3$ := $R_1 \\bowtie_c R_2$\n",
    "        - Take the product $R_1 \\times R_2$\n",
    "        - Then apply $\\sigma_c$ to the result\n",
    "    - As for $\\sigma, C$ can be any bookean alued condition\n",
    "    - Historic version of this poerator allowed only $A\\theta B$, where $\\theta$ is $=,<,$ ext; hence the name \"theta-join\"\n",
    "- Natural Join\n",
    "    - A useful join variant (_natural_ join) connects two relations by:\n",
    "        - Equating attributes of the same name, and \n",
    "        - Projecting out one copy of each pair of equated attributes\n",
    "   - Denoted $R_3 := R_1 \\bowtie R_2$\n",
    "- Renaming\n",
    "    - the $\\rho$ operator gives a new schema to a relation\n",
    "    - $R_1 := \\rho_{R_1(A_1,\\dots,A_n)}(R_2)$ makes $R_1$ be a relation with attributes $A_1,\\dots,A_n$ and the same tuples as $R_2$\n",
    "    - Simplified notation: $R_1(A_1,\\dots,A_n):=R_2$\n",
    "# Building Complex Expressions\n",
    "- Combine operations with parentheses and precedence rules\n",
    "- THree notations, just as in arithmetic:\n",
    "    1. Sequences of assignment statements\n",
    "    2. Expressions with several operators\n",
    "    3. Expression trees\n",
    "- Sequences of Assignments\n",
    "    - Create temporary relation names\n",
    "    - Reanaming can be implied by giving relations a list of attributes\n",
    "    - Precedence of relational operators\n",
    "        1. $[\\sigma,\\pi,\\rho]$\n",
    "        2. $[\\times, \\bowtie]$\n",

    "- Aggegation: COUNT\n",
    "    - COUNT applies to duplicates, unless otherwise stated\n",
    "- Grouping and Aggregation\n",
    "    - Semantics of the query:\n",

    "        2. Group by the attributes in the GROUP BY\n",
    "        3. Compute the SELECT clause: grouped attributes and aggregates\n",
