    "- How can we collect and store large amounts of data?\n",
    "    - By building tools and data structures to effeciently index and serve data\n",
    "- How can we efficiently query data?\n",
    "    - By compiling high-level declarative quereies into efficient low-level plans\n",
    "- How can we safely update data?\n",
    "    - By managing concurrent access to state as it is read and written\n",
    "- How do different databse systems anage design trade offs?\n",
    "    - e.g. at scale, in a distributed enviornment?\n",
    "How can I apply this knowledge?\n",
    "- Build almost any software application\n",
    "    - e.g., mobile cloud, consumer, enterpriese,analytics,machine learning\n",
    "    - Corollary: every application you use uses a database\n",
    "    - Bonus: every program consumes data (even if only the program text!)\n",
    "- Perfoming data analytics\n",
    "    - Buisness intelligence, data science, predictive odeling\n",
    "    - (Even if you're using Pandas, you're using relational algebra!)\n",
