    "## Terms\n",
    "- The number of tuples in a table (rows) is the cardinality of the relation\n",
    "- The number of attributes (columns) is the arity of the relation\n",
    "## Data Type\n",
    "- Atomic Types:\n",
    "    - Characters: Char(20), VarChar(50)\n",
    "    - Numbers: INT, BIGNINT, SMALLINT, FLOAT\n",
    "    - Others: MONEY, DATETIME,...\n",
    "- Every attribute must have an atomic type\n",
    "    - Hence table are flat\n",
    "## Table Schemas\n",
    "- The __schema__ of a table is the table name, its attributes, and thier types:\n",
    "    - Product (Pname: _string_, Price: _float_, Category: _string_, Manufacturer: _string_)\n",
    "- A __key__ is an attribute whose values are unique; we underline a key\n",
    "    - Product(Pname: string, Price: _float_, Category: _string_, Maunuacturer: _string_)\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Key Constraints\n",
    "- A key si a minimal subset of attributes that acts as a unique identifier for tuples in a relation\n",
    "- A key is an implicint constraint on which tuples can be in the relation\n",
    "    - i.e. if two tuples agree on the values of the key then they must be in the same tuple!\n",
    "## NULL and NOT NULL\n",
    "- To say \"don't know the value\" we use NULL\n",
    "    - NULL has (sometimes painful) semantics, more detail later\n",
    "## General Constraints\n",
    "- We can actually specify arbitrary assertions\n",
    "    - E.G. \"There cannot be 25 people in the DB class\"\n",
    "- In practice, we don't specify many such constraints. Why?\n",
    "    - Performance reasons\n",
    "- SQL Query\n",
    "    - Basic form (ther eare many many more bells and whitsles)\n",
    "        - SELECT attributes\n",
    "        - FROM one or more relations\n",
    "        - WHERE conditions\n",
    "    - Call this a SFW query\n",
    "- Simple SQL Query: Selection\n",
    "    - Selection is the opration of filttering a reation's tuples on some condition\n",
    "        - SELECT *\n",
    "        - FROM Product\n",
    "        - WHERE Category = 'Gadgets'\n",
    "- Simple SQl Query: Projection\n",
    "    - Projection is the operation of producing an output table with tuples that have a subset of thier prior attributes\n",
    "        - SELECT Pname, Price, Manufacturer\n",
    "        - FROM Product\n",
    "        - WHERE Category = 'Gadgets'\n",
    "## A Few Details\n",
    "- SQL commands are case insenstive\n",
    "    - same : SELECT, Select, select\n",
    "- Values are not:\n",
    "    - Different: 'Seattle', 'seattle'\n",
    "- Use single quotes for constatns\n",
    "    - 'abc' - yes\n",
    "    - \"abc\" - no\n",
    "- LIKE: Simple String Pattern Matching\n",
    "    - s LIKE p: pattern matching on strings\n",
    "    - p may contain two special symbls:\n",
    "        - s LIKE p: pattern matching on strings\n",
    "        - p may contain two special symbols:\n",
    "            - % = any sequence of characters\n",
    "            - _ = any singel character\n",
    "    - SELECT (\\*)\n",
    "    - FROM Products\n",
    "    - WHERE PName LIKE '%gizmo%'\n",
    "- Foreign Key Constraints\n",
    "    - Suppose we have the following schema:\n",
    "        - Students(sid: _string_, name: _string_, gpa: _float_)\n",
    "        - Enrolled(student\\_id: _string_, cid: _string_, grade: _string_)\n",
    "    - And we want to impose the following constraint:\n",
    "        - \"Only bona fide students may enroll in courses\" e,e, a student must appear in the Students table to enroll in a class\n",
    "    - we say that a student_id used to verify this is a __foreign key__ that refers to Students\n",
    "    - What if we insert a tuple into Enrolled, but no corresponding student?\n",
    "        - INSERGT is rejected (foreign keys are constraints)\n",
    "        - What if we delete a student?\n",
    "            1. Disallow the delete\n",
    "            2. Remove all of the courses for taht student\n",
    "- Joins\n",
    "    - A join between tables returns all unique combinations of their tuples which meet some specified join condition\n",
    "        "
